This is just a recreational personal project, but feel free to file an issue if you'd like me to add some documentation!

Getting started
---------------
Clone and enter the repo, then start Julia:
```terminal
git clone git@github.com:matthewelmer/ProgressBar.jl.git
cd ProgressBar.jl
julia
```

From the Julia REPL, activate the package and run the tests:
